# Portfolio-Modelling
Portfolio modeling was done using - Mean-Variance Optimization, HRP, Equal Weight, and Risk Parity across 93 Nifty stocks. Each technique aimed to optimize risk-return balance and was benchmarked against the Nifty Index using metrics like Sharpe Ratio, CAGR, and drawdown. HRP and Risk Parity showed strong risk-adjusted performance.
